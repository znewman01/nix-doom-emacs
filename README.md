nix-doom-emacs (abbreviated as NDE) provides a customisable Nix derivation for [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs).

The expression builds a `doom-emacs` distribution with dependencies
pre-installed based on an existing `~/.doom.d` directory.

It is not a fully fledged experience as some dependencies are not installed and
some may not be fully compatible as the version available in NixOS or
[emacs-overlay](https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay) may not be
compatible with the `doom-emacs` requirements.

# Quick Start

If you want to get a taste of nix-doom-emacs, you can run ``nix run github:nix-community/nix-doom-emacs``
Which will run nix-doom-emacs with an example configuration. 

Pick which setup you're using here (if you're not using NixOS or Home-Manager, then you should use standalone):

| Home-Manager | NixOS | Standalone |
|      ---     |  ---  |    ---     |
| [Flake + Home-Manager](./docs/reference.md#home-manager) | [NixOS](./docs/reference.md#nixos) | [Standalone](./docs/reference.md#standalone) |
